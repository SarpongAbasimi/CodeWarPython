Trees Introduction
Trees are an essential data structure for storing hierarchical data with a directed flow.

Similar to linked lists and graphs, trees are composed of nodes which hold data. The diagram represents nodes as circles and data as text.

Nodes also store references to zero or more other tree nodes. Data moves down from node to node. 
We depict those references as lines drawn between circles.

Trees are often displayed with a single node at the top and connected nodes branching downwards.

#Note - When a node has no children, we refer to it as a leaf node.
Trees grow downwards in computer science, and a root node is at the very top. The root of this tree is /photos.

Tree Varietals
Trees come in various shapes and sizes depending on the dataset modeled.

Some are wide, with parent nodes referencing many child nodes.

Some are deep, with many parent-child relationships.

Trees can be both wide and deep, but each node will only ever have at most one parent; otherwise, they wouldn't be trees!

Each time we move from a parent to a child, we're moving down a level.
Depending on the orientation we refer to this as the depth (counting levels down from the root node) or height (counting levels up from a leaf node).
